				<p>Being trapped in lockdown during a global pandemic has made me feel like a bird in a cage: desperate to be released but never knowing when, if ever, I can be free again. However, quarantine has come with its benefits. I: it has left me with plenty of inspirational emotions that I work to express through art.</p> 

				<p>For instance, I recently shot a photoshoot around the idea of a bird trapped in a cage, modelled by my friend Sami Brielle, a TikTok influencer. She stood masked against a backdrop of peacock feathers, arms intertwined to express her inability to escape her complex predicament.</p> 

				<p>Through my photographs, I hope to create an aesthetic response to sensation and emotion. My favorite subjects to photograph are athletes, especially gymnasts. I have always been captivated by the skills of my friend Lauren Navarro, a gymnast at Stanforda Stanford D1 Gymnast; as she flipped gracefully through the air, the tips of her hair would gently brush the ground. I worried that gravity would pull her down, swift and hard, but her momentum always swung her around and landed her lightly on her toes.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile, I worked on another photoshoot centered around the idea of perseverance, bending but not breaking, modelled by my friend Anne Arellano, a cirque performer. As waves crashed in the background, she balanced on canes buried in the sand and performed a contortion handstand. It’s insane how she did the impossible, bending more than anyone could ever imagine, and even more insane that that’s exactly what this pandemic has taught us to do. Despite the pressure weighing down on us, we have not broken, only bent. We’ve learned to endure and make something beautiful out of our suffering.</p>

				<p>Being able to collaborate with other people creatively during the pandemic has been challenging. However, since I moved home last spring after classes transitioned online, I have been able to find ways to connect with local musicians from St. Petersburg, Florida. I have been able to utilize outdoor spaces to continue producing music videos as well as portrait photography that allows musicians to continue promoting their music. Aleigha Everitt and Arin Muchitello comprise the duo “After Summer.” They were used to regularly writing and rehearsing in indoor spaces but they have been able to adapt to continue writing songs, rehearsinge their music and creatinge promotional content in outdoor spaces across various parks and beaches in Florida. These spaces not only serve as beautiful backdrops but socially distanced spaces for them to continue creating.</p>
